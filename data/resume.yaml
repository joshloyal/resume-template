summary:
  "I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
  In addition, I work part-time as a Data Scientist at DataRobot, a start-up in Boston
  aimed at building an automated Machine Learning platform.

  My previous background is in Physics (M.S. 2016 Yale University, B.S. 2013 Duke
  University) and Mathematics (B.S. 2013 at Duke University). During my physics career,
  I worked as a particle physicist as part of the ATLAS collaboration at the
  Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. There I performed large scale data
  analytics and contributed to the development of a Deep Learning framework (GAIA)
  for classifying subatomic-particle jets."
