  - title: Deep Learning
    details:
      - "Lead Data Scientist spearheading the initiative to use Google's TensorFlow to
        build a Deep Learning library that automates neural network building for various
        response variable distributions -- Binomial, Gaussian, Poisson, Gamma, and Tweedie
        -- as well as incorporates methods to handle high dimensional categorical variables
        using categorical embeddings."

  - title: Natural Language Processing
    details:
      - "Reduced text model memory usage -- a 50\\% improvement over the previous model --
        by storing the vocabulary in a Marisa Trie data structure duing inference and a C++
        un-ordered dictionary during training."
      - "Increased model accuracy by utilize new feature weighting schemes such as
        Delta-TFIDF and Binormal Seperation."
      - "Developed predictive models for NLP: regularized GLMs, SVMs, and CNNs over
        word embeddings."

  - title: Multiclass Classification
    details:
      - "Co-wrote a library to perform multi-class classification using a One-Vs-All scheme
        that included code for efficient data partitioning and custom objective functions
        such as multi-class AUC and confusion entropy."

  - title: Unsupervised Learning
    details:
      - "Lead Data Scientist on a project to incorporate unsupervised learning algorithms into
        the application."
      - "Implemented a Variational Autoencoder with a Normalizing Flow applied to the initial
        variational density to learn a scalable latent variable model over correlated
        categorical variables or text."
      - "Developed various clustering models such as K-means, K-medoids, K-modes, HDBSCAN,
        and Gaussian mixtures."

  - title: Leadership
    details:
      - "Member of the technical leadership group charged with monitoring code quality
        and design."
      - "Organizer of the Noontime Informal Paper Sessions (NIPS) weekly paper reading and
        discussion group."

- company: Yale University (ATLAS experiment at CERN)
  title: Graduate Researcher
  location: Geneva, Switzerland and New Haven, CT
  dates: 2013 -- 2014
  advisors: Tobias Golling, Keith Baker
  details:
  - title: Flavor-Tagging/Higgs Boson Classification
    details:
      - "Collaborated with an undergraduate to design GAIA, a deep learning framework for
        particle jet identification written in C++, which improved the accuracy of identifying
        signal events."
      - "Compared various classifiers, such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural
        networks, to determine the best performing model based on the model's ROC curve."

  - title: SUSY Snowmass Study
    details:
      - "Determination of statistical upper limits and discovery reach of SUSY simplified
        models with compressed mass spectra based on a statistical analysis of high
        dimensional and highly correlated Monte Carlo simulations."

- company: Duke University and ANL (ATLAS experiment at CERN)
  title: Undergraduate Researcher

  dates: 2010 -- 2013
  advisors: Alfred Goshaw, Sergei Chekanov
  details:
  - title: Higgs Boson Analysis
    details:
    - "Performed a quantitative analysis using data selected from a sample of more than 10
      billion events collected by the ATLAS experiment using C++, Python, ROOT
      (a C++ based analysis framework), Linux batch systems, and distributed analysis software
      similar to Hadoop."
    - "Created statistical models to predict the probability of observing rare physics
      processes with a low signal to background ratio. Tested these models with frequentist
      hypothesis tests using the profile likelihood test statistic."

  - title: Electroweak Analysis
    details:
      - "Cleaned, validated and prepared data for analysis. Identified irregularities within
        the data. Corrected problems in corrupt data where deemed possible. Extracted and
        selected appropriate subsets for analysis."
      - "Presented each step of the analysis using appropriate visualization techniques at
        ATLAS collaboration meetings."
